# Matt Soria's Halloween

This is a minisite for tracking what I do and watch each Halloween, cause I friggin love Halloween. It's a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build), deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), with content managed on Craft CMS via my [Mothership Connection](https://github.com/itsmattsoria/mothership-connection) project.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
